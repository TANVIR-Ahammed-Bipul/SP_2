In our campus the area is too large so as a result so the distance between hall and restaurant are not near.so we want to delivery food, medicine grocery and e-product by digitally at first we make a website then make an app . CampusMart will be a unique e-commerce platform exclusively designed to serve the needs of our university campus. It will provide a convenient, one-stop solution for students, faculty, and staff to order food, medicine, and grocery items online.
